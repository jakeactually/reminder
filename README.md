# reminder
A little app for reminding me to clock in. It's a popup that appears at certain times of the day.

The challenge was to make a gui app with low startup impact,
so frameworks were a no go, I had to use the windows api directly.
It end up using 0.2 mb and having medium startup impact, which is amazing.

My code is mostly at Reminder/Reminder.h
